Analyzing and visualizing the job placement trends for the School of Data Science (SDS) using Tableau.

This is one of the projects that I made as a Graduate Assistant in SDS for the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. The reports are implemented in the [DSBA (Data Science and Business Analytics) website](https://dsba.uncc.edu/about-us/alumni-profile).
